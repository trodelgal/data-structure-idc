# Sort Algorithms:

In assignment, I implemented several sorting algorithms, and evaluate their performance.
This project involves not only coding but also running my code on large data sets and preparing a
document analyzing their performance.

## Coding Sorting Algorithms:

5 sorting algorithms:
• Standard Quick Sort (2 versions),
• Merge Sort (2 versions)
• Radix Sort.
The project will contain:
• Generic Sort class, which implements the sorting methods.
• SortTest class which contains your main program.
It is critically important that:

## Check Algorithms Performance:

After I have finished coding and debugging My algorithms,
I measured the performance of my implementation in practice. I used SortTest class to test each
algorithm on both random and sorted arrays. To test the running time of My sorting
algorithms, I used the System.currentTimeMillis() method, which returns a long that contains
the current time (in milliseconds).
You can find my performence results in the file tesults.pdf.
